# Commandify: Making LLMs Speak CLI

## The Problem
Current LLM tool frameworks rely heavily on structured formats like JSON or function calling schemas. While these formats are great for machines, they're not what LLMs are naturally good at. This leads to:
- Frequent parsing errors when LLMs generate malformed JSON
- Need for larger, more expensive models to handle complex schemas
- Difficult error recovery when something goes wrong
- High complexity in tool integration

## The Solution
Commandify is a framework that lets LLMs interact with tools using CLI-style commands - a format they already understand deeply from their training data. Here's how it works:

1. **Tool Registration**: Tools are registered with CLI-style parameters
```python
register_tool(
    name="image-gen",
    description="Generate images from text",
    parameters=[
        Parameter("-p", "prompt text"),
        Parameter("--style", choices=["realistic", "anime"])
    ]
)
```

2. **Two-Step LLM Process**:
   - First prompt: Tool selection based on user request
   - Second prompt: Parameter generation in CLI format

3. **Built-in Validation Loop**:
   - Validates generated commands
   - Provides clear feedback for retry
   - Much easier for LLMs to fix `unknown flag --foo` than malformed JSON

## Why This Matters

1. **Natural Format**: CLI commands are everywhere in code repositories. LLMs have seen millions of examples of CLI usage in their training data, making this a more natural format than JSON schemas.

2. **Better Error Recovery**: When an LLM generates invalid JSON, recovery is hard. But with CLI commands, we can provide specific feedback that LLMs understand intuitively.

3. **Smaller Models**: The simpler format means smaller, cheaper models can reliably use tools. You don't need GPT-4 just to generate valid tool calls.

4. **Developer Friendly**: Adding new tools is as simple as defining their CLI interface - a format every developer already knows.

## Example Usage

```python
# User input
"Generate an anime-style image of a cat"

# LLM Tool Selection
"Selected tool: image-gen"

# LLM Command Generation
"image-gen -p 'cat sitting on windowsill' --style anime"

# If invalid, clear feedback
"Error: style must be one of [realistic, anime]"

# LLM retry with correction
"image-gen -p 'cat sitting on windowsill' --style realistic"
```

## Key Innovations

1. **Format Alignment**: Uses a command format that LLMs naturally understand from their training data
2. **Two-Step Process**: Breaks complex tool use into simpler, more reliable steps
3. **Clear Feedback Loop**: Makes error recovery natural and effective
4. **Lower Resource Requirements**: Makes tool use accessible to smaller models

## Next Steps

1. **Core Framework**: Implement the basic tool registration and LLM interaction pipeline
2. **Tool Library**: Create a set of example tools to demonstrate the framework
3. **Performance Testing**: Compare reliability versus JSON-based approaches
4. **Model Testing**: Evaluate performance across different model sizes

## Vision
Commandify aims to make LLM tool use more reliable, accessible, and natural. By working with LLMs' strengths rather than fighting against them, we can build more robust and efficient AI systems.
