    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on 
    creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human 
    intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, 
    decision-making, language translation, and problem-solving. AI systems are 
    powered by machine learning algorithms that enable them to learn from data 
    and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. Deep 
    learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks 
    inspired by the human brain to process complex patterns in large datasets. 
    As AI technology continues to advance, it is increasingly being integrated 
    into various aspects of our daily lives, from virtual assistants and 
    recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis tools.
